This Project include rating prediction based on reviews and Opinion mining of mobile features.
### First part
The objective of this project is to attempt the prediction of Smartphone reviews ratings from the Kaggle Mobile Phones dataset.

#### Supervised Learning Overview
1. Converting training data to to a set of vectors of features.
2. Build a model based on statistical properties of features in training dataset
